## Contributing

We greatly value the feedback and contributions of our users. We have a simple process in place to facilitate this:

### New Features and Issues

We try to minimise the noise in our Github Issues feed by first having a conversation in following [Golang CLI Development Room](https://gitter.im/sdkman/golang-cli).

After accepting a new feature or confirming that a bug was found, an Issue may be raised filling in the provided Issue Template on the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/sdkman/sdk/issues/new).

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests are _always_ very welcome, but require the initial discussion on Gitter followed by a Github Issue as described above. The PR template is to be filled in before submission, ensuring that it is _linked back_ to the Github Issue number by replacing `#XXX` with the appropriate Issue reference.

Each PR should also be accompanied by a passing test(s) proving it's validity (where feasible). The feasibility of the test will emerge in the initial discussions on Gitter and in the Github Issue.
