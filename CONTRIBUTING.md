## Contributing

We greatly value feedback and contributions. We have a simple process in place to facilitate this:

### Discussion

We try to minimise Github Issues and Pull Requests by first having a conversation in the following [Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/sdkman/golang-cli).

### Templates

After accepting a new feature or confirming that a bug was found, an Issue or PR may be opened. Please ensure that the appropriate template is read and completed prior to any new submissions.

**Unfortunately we will close any Github Issues or PRs that have not followed this process of prior discussion.**
